# my-py4e
This project is to save my files as I work through Dr. Charles Severance's excellent [Python for Everybody](https://py4e.com) (PY4E) course.

It's also a chance for me to refresh my command line and Git skills.

My files are going to be comment-heavy, probably excessively so, just because it's been so long since I coded anything and I'd rather play it safe right now.
