# my-py4e
This project is to save my files as I work through Dr. Charles Severance's excellent Python for Everybody (py4e) course. The course can be found here: https://py4e.com

It's also a chance for me to refresh my command line and git skils.

My files are going to be comment-heavy, probably excessively so, just because it's been so long since I coded anything and I'd rather play it safe right now.
