**Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?**

- [ ] a) Execute all of the computation and logic of the program
- [ ] b) Retrieve web pages over the Internet
- [x] c) Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle
- [ ] d) Take input from the user

**Exercise 2: What is a program?**

**Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?**

**Exercise 4: Which of the following contains "machine code"?**

- [x] a) The Python interpreter
- [ ] b) The keyboard
- [ ] c) Python source file
- [ ] d) A word processing document

**Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code:**
```python
>>> primt 'Hello world!'
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    primt 'Hello world!'
                           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>>
```

`primt` was entered incorrectly. It should be `print` instead. Additionally, the text `'Hello world!'` needs to be inside parentheses for the `print()` function to work. The code should be:
```python
>>> print('Hello world!')
```

**Exercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as "x" stored after the following Python line finishes?**
```python
x = 123
```
[ ] a) Central processing unit
[x] b) Main Memory
[ ] c) Secondary Memory
[ ] d) Input Devices
[ ] e) Output Devices

**Exercise 7: What will the following program print out:**
```python
x = 43
x = x + 1
print(x)
```
[ ] a) 43
[x] b) 44
[ ] c) x + 1
[ ] d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically

**Exercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability: (1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory, (3) Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device. For example, "What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit"?**

**Exercise 9: How do you fix a "Syntax Error"?**
